                "In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion\nof a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  We applied the results of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\nAny real body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\nA large class of problems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,\nsince real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in\nmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore\nthat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid."

Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body are moving together,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 6.1).\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\nConsider now the rolling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus ‘something else.’",

Fig. 6.4 shows\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis (the z-axis of the frame of reference).  Let P1\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\nand at a distance r1 from fixed axis.  The particle\nP1 describes a circle of radius  r1 with its centre\nC1 on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\nanother particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a\ndistance r2 from the fixed axis.

We know from experience\nthat the axis of such a spinning top moves\naround the vertical through its point of contact\nwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown\nin Fig. 6.5(a).

A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n3.\nIn rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n4.\nIn pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n5.\nAngular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ω has a fixed direction.\n6.\nThe vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absinθ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n7.\nThe linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = ω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the\nfixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one\npoint fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed\npoint taken as the origin.\n8.\nThe centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position\nvector is",

One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the\ncentre of mass MV2/2,\nK = K′ + MV2/2\n3.\nNewton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s\nSecond Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles.\n4.\nTo establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\nparticles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n5.\nThe vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque\nare independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total\nexternal force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.\n6.\nThe total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is\nzero.\n7.\nThe centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational\nfield does not vary from one part of the body to the other."
