                    "value": "In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motionof a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as apoint mass having no size.)  We applied the results of ourstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assumingthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of themotion of a particle.Any real body which we encounter in daily life has afinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle isinadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond thisinadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding ofthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in thefirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with theconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centreof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a systemof particles and usefulness of this concept in understandingthe motion of extended bodies.A large class of problems with extended bodies can besolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally arigid body is a body with a perfectly definite andunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs ofparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident fromthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But inmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a numberof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steelbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignorethat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treatthem as rigid."

We know from experiencethat the axis of such a spinning top movesaround the vertical through its point of contactwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shownin Fig. 6.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of thetop around the vertical is termed precession.)Note, the point of contact of the top withground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the topat any instant passes through the point ofcontact. Another simple example of this kind ofrotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestalfan [Fig.6.5(b)].

Both these figures showmotion of the same body along identicaltranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a),the motion is a pure translation; in the othercase [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translationand rotation. (You may try to reproduce the twotypes of motion shown, using a rigid object likea heavy book.)We now recapitulate the most importantobservations of the present section: The motionof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed insome way is either a pure translation or acombination of translation and rotation. Themotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixedin some way is rotation.  The rotation may beabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) ormoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)]).We shall, in the present chapter, considerrotational motion about a fixed axis only."

If there are no externalforces, the centre of mass of a double starmoves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equalmass are also shown in the figure; they lookcomplicated. If we go to the centre of massframe, then we find that there the two starsare moving in a circle, about the centre ofmass, which is at rest. Note that the positionof the stars have to be diametrically oppositeto each other [Fig. 6.14(b)]. Thus in our frameof reference, the trajectories of the stars are acombination of (i) uniform motion in a straightline of the centre of mass and (ii) circularorbits of the stars about the centre of mass.As can be seen from the two examples,separating the motion of different parts of asystem into motion of the centre of mass andmotion about the centre of mass is a veryuseful technique that helps in understandingthe motion of the system."

If the body is fixed at a point or alonga line, it has only rotational motion. We knowthat force is needed to change the translationalstate of a body, i.e. to produce linearacceleration. We may then ask, what is theanalogue of force in the case of rotationalmotion? To look into the question in a concretesituation let us take the example of opening orclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body whichcan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passingthrough the hinges. What makes the doorrotate? It is clear that unless a force is appliedthe door does not rotate. But any force does notdo the job. A force applied to the hinge linecannot produce any rotation at all, whereas aforce of given magnitude applied at right anglesto the door at its outer edge is most effective inproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, buthow and where the force is applied is importantin rotational motion.The rotational analogue of force in linearmotion is moment of force. It is also referred toas torque or couple. (We shall use the wordsmoment of force and torque interchangeably.)We shall first define the moment of force for thespecial case of a single particle. Later on weshall extend the concept to systems of particlesincluding rigid bodies. We shall also relate it toa change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. isangular acceleration of a rigid body."

Thus, the momentof a force vanishes if either the magnitude ofthe force is zero, or if the line of action of theforce passes through the origin.One may note that since  r \u00d7 F is a vectorproduct, properties of a vector product of twovectors apply to it. If the direction of F isreversed, the direction of the moment of forceis reversed. If directions of both r and F arereversed, the direction of the moment of forceremains the same."

Herethe moments of both the forces are equal, butthey are not opposite; they act in the same senseand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  Thetotal force on the body is zero; so the body is intranslational equilibrium; but it is not inrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is notfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.rotation without translation).A pair of forces of equal magnitude but actingin opposite directions with different lines ofaction is known as a couple or torque. A coupleproduces rotation without translation.When we open the lid of a bottle by turningit, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid[Fig. 6.21(a)]. Another known example is acompass needle in the earth\u2019s magnetic field asshown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth\u2019s magneticfield exerts equal forces on the north and southpoles. The force on the North Pole is towardsthe north, and the force on the South Pole istoward the south. Except when the needle pointsin the north-south direction; the two forces donot have the same line of action. Thus there isa couple acting on the needle due to the earth\u2019smagnetic field."

(6.42d), Lzmay be replaced by L .(L and Lz  are respectivelythe magnitudes of L and Lz.)This then is the required form, for fixed axisrotation, of Eq. (6.29a), which expresses thegeneral law of conservation of angular momentumof a system of particles.  Eq. (6.44) applies to manysituations that we come across in daily life.  Youmay do this experiment with your friend.  Sit on aswivel chair (a chair with a seat, free to rotateabout a pivot) with your arms folded and feet notresting on, i.e., away from, the ground.  Ask yourfriend to rotate the chair rapidly. While the chairis rotating with considerable angular speedstretch your arms horizontally.  What happens?Your angular speed is reduced.  If you bring backyour arms closer to your body, the angular speedincreases again.  This is a situation where theprinciple of conservation of angular momentumis applicable.
