                "In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion of a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a point mass having no size.)  We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies.   Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change.  It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid."

                        "block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewise movement.  The block is taken as a rigid body.  Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time. The rigid body here is in pure translational motion (Fig. 6.1). In pure translational motion at any instant of time, all particles of the body have the same velocity. Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, seems to have translational motion.  But as Fig. 6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body, therefore, is not in pure translational motion. Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’",

(We assume that the top does not slip from place to place and so does not have translational motion.)  We know from experience that the axis of such a spinning top moves around the vertical through its point of contact with the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown in Fig. 6.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the top around the vertical is termed  precession . ) Note, the  point of contact of the top with ground is fixed . The axis of rotation of the top at any instant passes through the point of contact. Another simple example of this kind of rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal fan [Fig.6.5(b)].

While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in more general cases of rotation, such as the rotation of a top or a pedestal fan,  one point and not one line,  of the rigid body is fixed. In this case the axis is not fixed, though it always passes through the fixed point. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.",

Suffice to say here that the trajectories of O are the translational trajectories Tr 1  and Tr 2  of the body. The positions O and P at three different instants of time are shown by O 1 , O 2 , and O 3 , and P 1 , P 2  and P 3 , respectively, in both Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 6.6(a), at any instant the velocities of any particles like O and P of the body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in this case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes with a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains the same, i.e.  α 1  =  α 2  =  α 3 . Fig. 6.6 (b) illustrates a case of combination of translation and rotation. In this case, at any instants the velocities of O and P differ. Also, α 1 ,  α 2  and  α 3  may all be different.",
                        "Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis only unless stated otherwise. The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the ‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion. You will find Fig. 6.6(a) and (b) instructive from this point of view. Both these figures show motion of the same body along identical translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a), the motion is a pure translation; in the other case [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translation and rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown, using a rigid object like a heavy book.) We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section:  The motion of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in some way is either a pure translation or a combination of translation and rotation. The motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed in some way is rotation.   The rotation may be about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or moving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)]). We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only."

The same symmetry argument will apply to homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even thick rods of circular or rectangular cross section.

In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a common occurrence. If there are no external forces, the centre of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14 (a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal mass are also shown in the figure; they look complicated. If we go to the centre of mass frame, then we find that there the two stars are moving in a circle, about the centre of mass, which is at rest. Note that the position of the stars have to be diametrically opposite to each other [Fig. 6.14(b)].

We also show the linear velocity vector  v  of the particle at P. It is along the tangent at P to the circle. Let P ′  be the position of the particle after an interval of time  ∆ t  (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP ′ describes the angular displacement  ∆ θ  of the particle in time  ∆ t . The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval   ∆ t  is  ∆ θ / ∆ t.  As ∆ t  tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller values), the ratio  ∆ θ / ∆ t  approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity d θ /d t  of the particle at the position P. We denote the instantaneous angular velocity   by   ω   (the Greek letter omega). We know from our study of circular motion that the magnitude of linear velocity   v  of a particle moving in a circle is related to the angular velocity of the particle  ω by the simple relation  r υ ω = , where  r  is the radius of the circle. We observe that at any given instant the relation   v r ω =  applies to  all particles of the rigid body.

Thus, particles on the axis are stationary. This verifies that the axis is  fixed . Note that we use the same angular velocity ω  for all the particles.  We therefore, refer to   ω as the angular velocity of the whole body . We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time .  Note that this characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis is  just another way  of saying as in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has the centre on the axis. In our discussion so far the angular velocity appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept it.

If the body is fixed at a point or along a line, it has only rotational motion. We know that force is needed to change the translational state of a body, i.e. to produce linear acceleration. We may then ask, what is the analogue of force in the case of rotational motion? To look into the question in a concrete situation let us take the example of opening or closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing through the hinges. What makes the door rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied the door does not rotate. But any force does not do the job. A force applied to the hinge line cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a force of given magnitude applied at right angles to the door at its outer edge is most effective in producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion. The rotational analogue of force in linear motion is  moment of force . It is also referred to as  torque  or  couple .  (We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.) We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle. Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies.

We shall recapitulate what effect the external forces have on a rigid body.

The forces change the translational state of the motion of the rigid body, i.e. they change its total linear momentum in accordance with Eq. (6.17). But this is not the only effect the forces have. The total torque on the body may not vanish. Such a torque changes the rotational state of motion of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular momentum of the body in accordance with Eq.

One can show that if the translational equilibrium condition [Eq. 6.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a shift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational equilibrium condition is independent of the location of the origin about which the torques are taken.

Two of these conditions correspond to translational equilibrium; the sum of the components of the forces along any two perpendicular axes in the plane must be zero. The third condition corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum of the components of the torques along any axis perpendicular to the plane of the forces must be zero. The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body may be compared with those for a particle, which we considered in earlier chapters. Since consideration of rotational motion does not apply to a particle, only the conditions for translational equilibrium (Eq. 6.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of all the forces on it must be zero. Since all these forces act on the single particle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent forces was discussed in the earlier chapters. A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it may be in translational equilibrium and not in rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational equilibrium and not in translational equilibrium.

Here the moments of both the forces are equal, but they are not opposite; they act in the same sense and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The total force on the body is zero; so the body is in translational equilibrium; but it is not in rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e. rotation without translation). A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite directions with different lines of action is known as a  couple  or  torque .  A couple produces rotation without translation. When we open the lid of a bottle by turning it, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid [Fig. 6.21(a)]. Another known example is a compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as shown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth’s magnetic field exerts equal forces on the north and south poles. The force on the North Pole is towards the north, and the force on the South Pole is toward the south.

As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the  radius of gyration .

The radius of gyration of a body about an axis  may be defined as the distance from the axis of a mass point whose mass is equal to the mass of the whole body and whose moment of inertia is equal to the moment of inertia of the body about the axis.

The property of this extremely important quantity  I,  as a measure of rotational inertia of the body, has been put to a great practical use. The machines, such as steam engine and the automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational motion have a disc with a large moment of inertia, called a  flywheel . Because of its large moment of inertia, the flywheel resists the sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.",

Since the axis is fixed, only those components of torques, which are along the direction of the fixed axis need to be considered in our discussion. Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis. A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position. We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the (external) torques, so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained. The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account. This means that for our calculation of torques on a rigid body: (1)   We need to consider only those forces that lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Forces which are parallel to the axis will give torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account.

As said above we need to consider only those forces which lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Let  F 1  be one such typical force acting as shown on a particle of the body at point P 1  with its line of action in a plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience we call  this to be the  x ′ –y ′   plane (coincident with the plane of the page).

Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e., the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles  K  as the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass  K ′  and the kinetic energy of the centre of mass  MV 2 /2,        K  =  K ′  + MV 2 /2 3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s Second Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles. 4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second law for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between any two particles act along the line joining the particles. 5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total external force is zero, but total torque is non-zero. 6. The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is zero. 7.
