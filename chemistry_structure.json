The electrical \ndischarge through the gases could be \nobserved only at very low pressures and at \nvery high voltages. The pressure of different \ngases could be adjusted by evacuation of the \nglass tubes. When sufficiently high voltage \nis applied across the electrodes, current \nstarts flowing through a stream of particles \nmoving in the tube from the negative \nelectrode (cathode) to the positive electrode \n(anode). These were called cathode rays or \ncathode ray particles. The flow of current \nfrom cathode to anode was further checked \nby making a hole in the anode and coating \nthe tube behind anode with phosphorescent \nmaterial zinc sulphide. When these rays, \nafter passing through anode, strike the zinc \nsulphide coating, a bright spot is developed \non the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].",

The electrons in the completely \nfilled shells are known as core electrons and \nthe electrons that are added to the electronic \nshell with the highest principal quantum \nnumber are called valence electrons. For \nexample, the electrons in Ne are the core \nelectrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are \nthe valence electrons. In potassium (K) and \ncalcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in \nenergy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by \none and two electrons respectively.\nA new pattern is followed beginning with \nscandium (Sc). The 3d orbital, being lower \nin energy than the 4p orbital, is filled first. \nConsequently, in the next ten elements, \nscandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), \nchromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), \ncobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc \n(Zn), the five 3d orbitals are progressively \noccupied. We may be puzzled by the fact \nthat chromium and copper have five and ten \nelectrons in 3d orbitals rather than four and \nnine as their position would have indicated \nwith two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The \nreason is that fully filled orbitals and half-\nfilled orbitals have extra stability (that is, \nlower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc. \nconfigurations, which are either half-filled \nor fully filled, are more stable. Chromium \nand copper therefore adopt the d5 and \nd10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution: \nexceptions do exist] \nWith the saturation of the 3d orbitals, \nthe filling of the 4p orbital starts at gallium \n(Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the \nnext eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb) \nto xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5s, \n4d and 5p orbitals are similar to that of 4s, \n3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then \ncomes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium \n(Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains \none and two electrons, respectively. Then from \nlanthanum (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up \nof electrons takes place in 4f and 5d orbitals.",

These questions have \nno answer in the Daltonian model of atom. \nA detailed understanding of the electronic \nstructure of atom is, therefore, very essential \nfor getting an insight into the various aspects \nof modern chemical knowledge."

                        "Atoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that \nchemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as \nthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was \nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: \nelectrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal \nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity \nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to \nbe evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle \nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively \ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits. \nRutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over \nThomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron \ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of \natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The \ndifficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the \nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. \nOnly certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated \nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the \nelectron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the \nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The \nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged \nparticle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of \nthe electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can \ncompletely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron \nat the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty \nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour \nof electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. \nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to \ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This \nequation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with \nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a \nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and \nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the \nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding \nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal \nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml) \narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions \non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The \nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the \nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the \nBohr model.\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an \natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought \nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or \nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems \n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of \nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value \nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, \nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are",

                        "possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance \nwith Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four \nquantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the \norbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to \nthat subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the \nelectronic structure of atoms."
